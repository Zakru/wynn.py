Welcome to wynn.py's documentation!
===================================

wynn.py is a Python wrapper for the Wynncraft public API. The target of
wynn.py is to create an easy-to-use interface to the API with a focus on
readable code. Therefore all functions return a Python object in the
same format as the API's JSON data, occasionally with some utility
functionality.
